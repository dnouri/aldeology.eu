                    <p>Collaborated with marine biologists from Oregon State University to apply deep learning techniques to whale call detection. Developed a convolutional neural network model that outperformed traditional methods, especially in noisy underwater environments. Presented findings at the International Workshop on Detection, Classification, Localization, and Density Estimation (DCLDE) of Marine Mammals using Passive Acoustics. The project contributed to improved understanding of North Atlantic Right Whale migration patterns, potentially discovering winter presence in unexpected northern areas. This work highlighted the potential of interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning experts and marine biologists.</p>

                    <p>Developed an innovative, interactive visualisation app that provides real-time mapping of Swedish Police reports. This project leverages <a href="https://github.com/dnouri/polisen-se-events-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml">GitHub Actions for data scraping</a> and an entirely client-side <a href="">HTML5 app</a> to display a searchable and categorised list of public Swedish police reports. The app empowers citizens with local incident information, provides crucial insights for OSINT professionals, and aids in risk assessment for event planning and business advisory. This project builds on similar work performed at Securitas Group, where I led the development of an AI-powered news aggregator that scraped and analysed news from thousands of websites, grouping them by topic, summarising key points, and scoring their relevance with regard to security using LLMs, enhancing in-house open source intelligence capabilities.</p>

This framework gained traction and became one of the most used frameworks in Kaggle competitions starting starting 2016.  It pioneered the idea of extensibility in beginner-friendly deep learning frameworks through the use of callbacks and other extension mechanisms, which were later on refined by <a href="https://github.com/dnouri/skorch/">Skorch</a>, another project that we co-authored, and the highly popular Keras framework by Fran√ßois Chollet.</p>
